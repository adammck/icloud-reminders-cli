# iCloud Reminders CLI

This is a little Ruby app to view, create, and update iCloud reminders on the
command line. It works with Ruby 1.8.7, so can be installed on OSX without any
fuss. Not that there's an installer yet. But there will be.

It's still new, and is very rough around the edges. So probably don't use this
for anything important yet, but do check it out. It works.

It's built on [ruby-icloud] [ruby-icloud], which is a Ruby library for accessing
iCloud stuff. You might enjoy that, too.
